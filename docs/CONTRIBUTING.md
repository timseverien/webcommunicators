# Contributing guide

## Submit a communicator

Anyone that applies as a web communicator (see [Who can I add?](#who-can-i-add)), can be by:

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository
- Add someone to the file `src/communicator.ts`
  - Check out `src/channel.ts` to find out what channels are available.
- Submit a pull request — one addition at a time, please

## Who can I add?

Anyone that regularly shares web-related content. If that’s you, add yourself! If that’s a friend or someone you follow, add them, too! The more, the merrier.

## I want to be removed

That’s a shame. You can submit a pull request, or create an issue, and we’ll take care of it as soon as possible.

## I’m missing a channel

Feel to add one by creating an issue or submitting a pull request!
